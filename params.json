{"name":"Jamchat","tagline":"The JamChat Project Page","body":"# JamChat\r\nJamChat is a simple client-server communication service written in Java. The project is split into 3 separate parts.\r\n<p/>\r\nThe core client is a library for a user front-end to utilize. This contains the core methods for the program and lets\r\nthe GUI or Terminal client front-end handle presentation and other aspects. This brings us to the second part of the\r\nproject; the user interface. The user interface should use the client core library for its main functions, while handling\r\nwhat it does with the information from the core itself.\r\n<p/>\r\nThe final part of the project is the server. As the server requires no user interface, the core is not a library and\r\nshould be run by itself. The server should manage a list of known clients and handle connecting them and maintaining the\r\nconnection between them.\r\n\r\n## Diagrams\r\n#### Project Overview\r\n![project_overview](http://i.imgur.com/8YtRvIi.png)\r\n<p/>\r\n#### Starting a chat\r\n![chat_start](http://i.imgur.com/znT30Bq.png)\r\n","google":"UA-42872685-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
